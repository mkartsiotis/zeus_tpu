# Zeus TPU

## Basic Idea

TPU's are the backbone of the recent AI breakthroughs and as a hardware technology seem to be less complex and more optimized than modern cpu's.
All of these led to the decision of creating a tpu based on verilog as a personal project, to enhance the understanding of TPUS and AI and develop skills, specifically learning to create VLSI's with verilog.

## Project Outline

Since the creator of this repository is a complete beginner in all of these things it is better to break the process into smaller steps and targets before pushing through the creation of a complex general system.

## Inital steps for building the basic skills  

### Step 1

Create a register file as a structure in Verilog similar(or even almost identical) to the MIPS processor one and test it by reading and writing data on it.  
MIPS architecture was selected due to prior knowledge as well as availability of resources, though the register file will become RISC-V architecture in the near future.  

### Step 2

Create a simple ALU capable of basic arithmetic operations(on the MIPS architecture as well and then enhance it).  
Make the ALU perform vector operations and maybe add floating point arithmetic(though not necessary for small 4-bit quantized models)

### Step 3

Connect all the parts together. Create a single cycle pipeline capable of performing basic operations.

### Step 4

Add pipelining and finetune the architecture by creating a hazard mitigation unit and forwarding.  

### Step 5

Create or use an existing MIPS assembler based on this specific architecture and test the system.

### Step 6

Back to basics. Clean redesign of everything ISA, Cache and design choices.
Create a complete and organized plan for the TPU architecture.

### NEXT STEPS

Build, test, fail, iterate!  

### Project Progress

Restarted the project recently with the hope of mastering Verilog and SystemVerilog design techniques starting from the basics and scaling up.
Quickly noticed that building a TPU without a dedicated CPU would be a mistake so in the coming weeks I will be designing a RISC 5 stage pipelined CPU that will be used in parallel with the TPU.  

I am also working on discreet simulations for every part of the CPU that I am building, getting familiar with simulation tools that are going to help trace down errors quickly once the project is scaled.  

Just completed the basic ALU modules and now focusing on the wrapper as well as the register file.  
Main target for the coming days is building a single cycle basic system, then run tests and verifications on that before scaling and optimizing to a 5 stage pipeline with custom propagation units etc...

## ALU design choices and OPCODES

| Opcode (`3:0`) | Operation | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0000` | `ADD` | Addition | Adds `x` and `y`<br> |
| `0001` | `SUB` | Subtraction | Subtracts `y` from `x`<br> |
| `0010` | `AND` | Bitwise AND | Performs `x & y`<br> |
| `0011` | `SLT` | Set Less Than | Signed comparison: returns `1` if `x < y`, else `0`<br> |
| `0100` | `OR` | Bitwise OR | Performs `x | y`<br> |
| `0101` | `XOR` | Bitwise XOR | Performs `x ^ y`<br> |
| `0110` | `NOR` | Bitwise NOR | Performs `~(x | y)`<br> |
| `0111` | `SLTU` | Set Less Than Unsigned | Unsigned comparison: returns `1` if `x < y`, else `0`<br> |
| `1000` | `SLL` | Shift Left Logical | Logical left shift of `x` by shift amount `y`<br> |
| `1001` | `SRL` | Shift Right Logical | Logical right shift of `x` by shift amount `y`<br> |

### ALU Design choices

1.A common adder/subtractor was used so as to use the least amount of gates possible. Adding and subtracting is done with 2's compliment. Overflow and cout signals are also used and outputed by the ALU for possible future use.  
2. For all the other modules the operations are happening all at once and then with multiplexers the output is filtered to the output asked by the ALU op.  
3. The ALU operations that were chosen are the above(see table with opcodes). No not is used since this is done by nor(the assembler will later construct not as a pseudo-instruction). So the bitwise operations are more than enough for the usecase of running simple programs and testing.  
4. Multiplication and division will be done by different modules that will work in parallel with the ALU in the future.  
5. For shift operations only a small portion of the second inputs is used as it is the case with most RISC processors.  
> Pending: ALU simulation with the synthesized system and benchmark grading.

## REGISTER FILE  

### Design Choices  

1. The register file consists of 32 registers each capable of holding 32 bits. This design choice is not optimal for an ML/GPU architecture but the register file is written so to be modular so it can be repurposed in future architectures.  
2. There actually no physical $0 register! This is done so as to minimize gate usage so $0 it is actually hardwired to the ground.  
3. There is no read enabled and the read logic is completely combinational and thus unrelated to the clock. Write logic is however positively edge triggered in relation to the clock.

## ISA and more design decisions  

### Why RISC-V over MIPS?  

- Future TPU Integration: The RV32I specification explicitly reserves dedicated opcode space (custom-0 through custom-3) for custom instruction extensions. This provides a clean interface for adding matrix-multiplication and vector acceleration units (TPU) without altering standard decoder behavior.  

- Standard Register Alignment: Fixed bit fields for source (rs1, rs2) and destination (rd) registers allow register file read operations to occur in parallel with instruction decoding.  

- Modern Ecosystem: Aligns with current industry standards for open-source hardware accelerators.  
**For all the above reasons the RISC-V ISA will be used for the project**  

## Designing the Sign Extension module for immediate instructions  

For reference this is the RISC-V RV32I subset that is going to be used as the main ISA.  

### Canonical Base RV32I Subset

| Instruction | Type | Opcode (`[6:0]`) | Funct3 (`[14:12]`) | Funct7 (`[31:25]`) | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `add` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `000` | `0000000` | `rd = rs1 + rs2` |
| `sub` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `000` | `0100000` | `rd = rs1 - rs2` |
| `and` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `111` | `0000000` | `rd = rs1 & rs2` |
| `or` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `110` | `0000000` | `rd = rs1 | rs2` |
| `xor` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `100` | `0000000` | `rd = rs1 ^ rs2` |
| `slt` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `010` | `0000000` | `rd = (rs1 < rs2) ? 1 : 0` (Signed) |
| `sltu` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `011` | `0000000` | `rd = (rs1 < rs2) ? 1 : 0` (Unsigned) |
| `sll` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `001` | `0000000` | `rd = rs1 << rs2[4:0]` |
| `srl` | R | `0110011` (`0x33`) | `101` | `0000000` | `rd = rs1 >> rs2[4:0]` |
| `addi` | I | `0010011` (`0x13`) | `000` | N/A | `rd = rs1 + SignExt(imm)` |
| `lw` | I | `0000011` (`0x03`) | `010` | N/A | `rd = Mem[rs1 + SignExt(imm)]` |
| `sw` | S | `0100011` (`0x23`) | `010` | N/A | `Mem[rs1 + SignExt(imm)] = rs2` |
| `beq` | B | `1100011` (`0x63`) | `000` | N/A | `if (rs1 == rs2) PC = PC + SignExt(imm)` |
| `jal` | J | `1101111` (`0x6F`) | N/A | N/A | `rd = PC + 4; PC = PC + SignExt(imm)` |

**So based on the type of the instruction (with a simple case statement in Verilog for the opcode) we are going to sign extend the specific field and produce as output a 32bit number**  
Here are the opcodes for the main instructions of the subset:  

| Instruction | Format | Opcode (`inst[6:0]`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| add, sub, and, or, xor, slt, sltu, **sll, srl** | R | `0110011` |
| addi | I | `0010011` |
| lw | I | `0000011` |
| sw | S | `0100011` |
| beq | B | `1100011` |
| jal | J | `1101111` |
